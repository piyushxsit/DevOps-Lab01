                Version Control is a tool used in software developmnent and collaborative projects to
                track and manage changes t0 source code, documents and other files. Some 
                examples of version control tools include Git, Mercurial, Subversion.
                Distributed version control systems contain multiple repositories. Each user has their own repository and working copy. Just committing your changes will not give others access to your changes. This is because commit will reflect those changes in your local repository and you need to push them in order to make them visible on the central repository.
